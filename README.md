These codes were developed by Nami Nishimura for Space Astronomy Summer Program at Space Telescope Science Institute 

### The Project Goal 
Investigate the metal flow and change in metallicity inside the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
using a cosmological simulation of Milky Way-like Galaxies "Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE)"


# Summary 1 

This code will 

- Load the data for a cirtain galaxy from FOGGIE simulation 
- First, define the circumgalactic medium by temperature limit and density limit
- Split the CGM into high, medium and low density/ temperature/ metallicity 
- Track the flux of metal mass through a surface at a given radius at a given time 
- Track the amount of metal mass inside the CGM over time 
- Make plots of metal mass vs age for high, medium and low density/ tempearture/ metallicity 
- Make animation of the flux at a given radius over time 

### This code shows that 

- Metals formed inside the disk are carried by hot metal-rich gas and passed through CGM, not remaining there 
- For metal, outflows are bigger than inflows since they are formed inside the disk 
- For gas, inflows are bigger than outflows 
- Time dependent outburst of hot metal-rich gas conributes to the hot gas's high variation in metallicity
