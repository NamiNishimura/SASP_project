These codes were developed by Nami Nishimura for Space Astronomy Summer Program at Space Telescope Science Institute 

### The Project Goal 
Investigate the metal flow and change in metallicity inside the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
using a cosmological simulation of Milky Way-like Galaxies "Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE)"


# Summary 1 

This code will 

- Load the data for a cirtain galaxy from FOGGIE simulation 
- First, define the circumgalactic medium by temperature limit and density limit
- Split the CGM into high, medium and low density/ temperature/ metallicity 
- Track the flux of metal mass through a surface at a given radius at a given time 
- Track the amount of metal mass inside the CGM over time 
- Make plots of metal mass vs age for high, medium and low density/ tempearture/ metallicity 
- Make animation of the flux at a given radius over time 

### This code shows that 

- Metals formed inside the disk are carried by hot metal-rich gas and passed through CGM, not remaining there 
- For metal, outflows are bigger than inflows since they are formed inside the disk 
- For gas, inflows are bigger than outflows 
- Time dependent outburst of hot metal-rich gas conributes to the hot gas's high variation in metallicity 


# Summary 2 

This code will 
- Make projected density plot of CGM, with density/ temperature/ metallicity cut 
- Make metallicity histogram for different HI column density 
- Make metallicity histogram of projected data 
- Make phase plots of density, tempearture, metallicity, and metal mass 
- Make profile plot of density, radial velocity and temperature with standard deviation 
- Make plot of metal mass/ gas mass/ young stars vs time 
- Calcualte star formation rate over time 

### This code shows that 
- Only the absorption line of gas with high HI density can be observed and therefore observational metallicity histogram tends to shift to lower metallicity
- There's a trend of increasing metallicity with increasing temperature 
- Hot gas has high variation in metallicity 
- The outburst of the hot gas caused sudden increase in metal mass inside the CGM 
- Young star formation rate corresponds to the metal mass change
